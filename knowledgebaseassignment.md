## Assignment 2: Knowledge Bases vs Databases

In the realm of Expert Systems and Machine Learning, it's imperative to distinguish between knowledge bases and databases, as they serve distinct purposes with unique attributes.

**Knowledge Base:**

A knowledge base serves as a reservoir for domain-specific knowledge, rules, and expertise harnessed in expert systems and decision-making processes. It encapsulates well-organized domain-specific information that aids in problem-solving. Within expert systems, the knowledge base encompasses rules and facts that guide the decision-making process.

**Database:**

In contrast, a database functions as a structured repository for data storage, retrieval, and management. Databases are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval and form the backbone of numerous data-driven applications. They primarily store raw data and facilitate structured querying and retrieval, often utilizing the Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation.

In summary, a knowledge base focuses on domain-specific reasoning and decision-making, leveraging explicit rules and knowledge. Conversely, a database is primarily concerned with the structured storage and retrieval of data, devoid of inherent reasoning capabilities.
